# Retrieval of data from a json 
This function and primary aim of this repo is to retrieve data from a json(data) file

- ##  roster_data.json
    **Note:**_This file was made available for the tweaking and test-running of the python codes/ program made available in this repo!
    
    This is a json file that is filled with data in which we are going to be parsing and printing out our desired piece of data/ information needed or intented.
    ```json
    [
    "Gaia",
    "si110",
    1
  ],
  ```
  A block of the json code/ program is exactly like this code snippet above. 
  - **"Gaia"**: Is represented here as the name of a student.
The other python file 'rosterdb.py' is python code with a bit of sqlite. This code is to retrieve your data and store it into an sqlite database for later use.
I provided a json data file, if you would like to test and tweak around the codes.
The python codes above are to be modified based on the json data and what you need from it!
